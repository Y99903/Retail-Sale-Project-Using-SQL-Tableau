Retail Sales SQL + Tableau Project

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Retail Sales Database in MySQL, followed by the creation of an interactive Tableau Dashboard to visualize key business insights.

I created the schema, inserted data, built indexes, wrote analytical queries, and finally connected the database to Tableau to present sales trends, top-performing products, and store-wise performance.

🏗️ Database Design

The project contains the following tables:

1.⁠ ⁠Customers

customer_id (PK, Auto Increment)

customer_name

city

country

signup_date



2.⁠ ⁠Products

product_id (PK, Auto Increment)

product_name

category

price



3.⁠ ⁠Stores

store_id (PK, Auto Increment)

store_name

region



4.⁠ ⁠Orders

order_id (PK, Auto Increment)

order_date

customer_id (FK → Customers)

total_amount



5.⁠ ⁠Order Items

order_item_id (PK, Auto Increment)

order_id (FK → Orders)

product_id (FK → Products)

quantity

unit_price

⚙️ Key Implementation Steps

🔍 SQL Queries Performed

1.⁠ ⁠Total Sales

SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales FROM orders;


2.⁠ ⁠Monthly Sales Trend

SELECT 
    MONTH(order_date) AS month, 
    SUM(total_amount) AS monthly_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY MONTH(order_date);


3.⁠ ⁠Product List (Price Order)

SELECT product_name, price 
FROM products
ORDER BY product_name DESC;


4.⁠ ⁠Product Revenue (with JOIN)

SELECT 
    p.product_name, 
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_revenue
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
