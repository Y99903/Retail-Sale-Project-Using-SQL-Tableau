Retail Sales SQL + Tableau Project

üìå Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Retail Sales Database in MySQL, followed by the creation of an interactive Tableau Dashboard to visualize key business insights.

I created the schema, inserted data, built indexes, wrote analytical queries, and finally connected the database to Tableau to present sales trends, top-performing products, and store-wise performance.

üîç SQL Queries Performed

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Total Sales

2.‚Å† ‚Å†Monthly Sales Trend

SELECT 
    MONTH(order_date) AS month, 
    SUM(total_amount) AS monthly_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY MONTH(order_date);


3.‚Å† ‚Å†Product List (Price Order)

SELECT product_name, price 
FROM products
ORDER BY product_name DESC;


4.‚Å† ‚Å†Product Revenue (with JOIN)

SELECT 
    p.product_name, 
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_revenue
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
